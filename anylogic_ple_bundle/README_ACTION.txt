MANUAL ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR ANYLOGIC PLE:

1. Open the `anylogic_snippets/` folder. Paste the contents of `AdditionalClassCode.txt`, `OnStartup.txt`, and `OnStep.txt` into the corresponding "Additional Class Code", "On Startup", and "On Step" fields of your Main agent in AnyLogic.

2. Ensure the `resources/` folder from this bundle is copied to your AnyLogic project's root directory so the simulation can find the images.
